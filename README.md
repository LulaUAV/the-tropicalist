# The Tropicalist 5" Frame Kit
Developed to be the best FPV frame in the world, no matter what is your application. Born in Brazil.

## Quick Notice
This project was initially close-source. We opened to be part of a greater achievement for the FPV community, as well as to expand reach and dissipate knowledge. By doing so, we lost a great share of revenue. To support its constant evolution, consider a donation.

## Short Read
This frame was developed to be easily assembled, strong, accessible, and performatic for any 5' FPV build. Focused on having a better performance than traditional frames with respect to resonant frequencies, it is a great build for cinematics and freestyle pilots. You can download the latest files under the releases page, and follow the instructions here for fabrication.

## Long Read
The Tropicalist Frame Kit was initially developed in 2020 during the pandemic, in which a great flow of imports in Brazil was frozen. To keep the FPV rolling here, we needed a frame that could be strong enough to withstand the tropical bandos and also cinematic ready, since a new era of pilots was born.

The Frame is a perfect X configuration, has 5mm arms, and is designed for up to 5.1in props. It has enough space for analog and digital builds and it's designed to carry a camera on top, as well as a 4s-6s battery.

For the Frame to perform at its best, is expected that fabrication using 3K plain matte carbon, from a good supplier is used. In all tests, the best-performing carbon fiber plates were from Sunlike (please send files to quote to info@sunlikecc.com). If you are using other composites or materials be aware that it can be extremely poor on performance, since the materials' mechanical properties are key in this design.

## Scientific Based Research
The Tropicalist Frame is based on scientific research to approach a feasible, high-frequency resonant frame. It is also tested in Structural FEA Analysis Software (such as Ansys Mechanical) before being released. All major changes should include a FEA Analysis and field testing prior to being considered a new release under the main branch. If you want to consider collaborating on this project, please follow the guidelines here for contributing, and our step-by-step process to have PRs accepted. We do this to guarantee the highest standard in design quality and best practices, so users and the community can rely on a frame without being super nerds about mechanical aspects. They just trust, and thatÂ´s enough :)
