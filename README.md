# The Tropicalist 5" FPV Open Source Frame Kit
Developed to be the best FPV frame in the world, no matter what is your application. Born in Brazil.

## Quick Notice
This project was initially close-source. We opened to be part of a greater achievement for the FPV community, as well as to expand reach and dissipate knowledge. By doing so, we lost a great share of revenue. To support its constant evolution, [consider a donation][1].

## Short Read
This frame was developed to be easily assembled, strong, and accessible for any 5' FPV build. Focused on having a better performance than traditional frames with respect to resonant frequencies, it is a great build for cinematics and freestyle pilots. You can download the latest files under the [Carbon Cut Files][5] page, and follow the [instructions for fabrication][4]. You can order the parts to construct the frame using this [Bill of Materials][6].

## Long Read
The Tropicalist Frame Kit was initially developed in 2020 during the pandemic, during which a great flow of imports in Brazil was frozen. To keep the FPV rolling here, we needed a frame that could be strong enough to withstand the tropical bandos and also cinematic ready, since a new era of pilots was born.

The Frame is a perfect X configuration, has 5mm arms, and is designed for up to 5.1in props. It has enough space for analog and digital builds and it's designed to carry a camera on top, as well as a 4s-6s battery.

For the Frame to perform at its best, is expected that fabrication using 3K plain matte carbon, from a good supplier is used. If you are using other composites or materials be aware that it can be extremely poor on performance, since the materials' mechanical properties are key in this design.

## Scientific-Based Research
The Tropicalist Frame is based on scientific research to approach a feasible, high-frequency resonant frame. It is also tested in Structural FEA Analysis Software (such as Ansys Mechanical) before being released. All major changes should include a FEA Analysis and field testing prior to being considered a new release under the main branch. If you want to consider collaborating on this project, [please follow the guidelines here for contributing][2], and our step-by-step process to have PRs accepted. We do this to guarantee the highest standard in design quality and best practices, so users and the community can rely on a frame without being super nerds about mechanical aspects. They just trust, and that´s enough :)
