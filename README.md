# The Tropicalist 5" FPV Open Source Frame Kit :bird:
Developed to be the best FPV frame in the world, no matter what is your application. Born in Brazil. Join the community for support, news, and other major releases, as well as to get help during your development [in our discord][7].

*PT_BR: Se você quer entender melhor do frame assim como seus aspectos principais, em portugês, acesse www.tropicalfpv.com*

## Quick Notice :dollar:
This project was initially close-source. We opened to be part of a greater achievement for the FPV community, as well as to expand reach and dissipate knowledge. By doing so, we lost a great share of revenue. To support its constant evolution, [consider a donation][1].

## Short Read :envelope:
This frame was developed to be easily assembled, strong, and accessible for any 5' FPV build. Focused on having a better performance than traditional frames with respect to resonant frequencies, it is a great build for cinematics and freestyle pilots. 
1. Start by downloading the latest files under the [Carbon Cut Files][5] page,
2. You can order the parts to construct the frame using this [Bill of Materials][6],
3. Follow the [instructions for fabrication][4]

## Long Read :book:

### Objectives and Configuration :dart:
The Tropicalist Frame Kit was initially developed in 2020 during the pandemic, during which a great flow of imports in Brazil was frozen. To keep the FPV rolling here, we needed a frame that could be strong enough to withstand the tropical bandos and also cinematic ready, since a new era of pilots was born.

The Frame is a perfect X configuration, has 5mm arms, and is designed for up to 5.1in props. It has enough space for analog and digital builds and it's designed to carry a camera on top, as well as a 4s-6s battery.

For the Frame to perform at its best, is expected that fabrication using 3K plain matte carbon, from a good supplier is used. If you are using other composites or materials be aware that it can be extremely poor on performance, since the materials' mechanical properties are key in this design.

### Editing and Modifying the Files :rocket:
You can modify and download the original Autodesk Fusion 3D Files. Those are available [here][8]. If you want to consider collaborating on this project, [please follow the guidelines here for contributing][2], and our step-by-step process to have PRs accepted.

### Scientific-Based Research :microscope:
The Tropicalist Frame is based on scientific research to approach a feasible, high-frequency resonant frame. It is also tested in Structural FEA Analysis Software (such as Ansys Mechanical) before being released. All major changes should include a FEA Analysis and field testing prior to being considered a new release under the main branch. We do this to guarantee the highest standard in design quality and best practices, so users and the community can rely on a frame without being super nerds about mechanical aspects. They just trust, and that´s enough :)
